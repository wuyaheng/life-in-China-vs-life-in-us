          <p>Whenever I talk with friends who live in China over the phone, I’m surprised by the changes that have happened in China over the past 7 years since I came to the US to study and work. For example, living in the US, I usually pay with my credit card; however, people today living in China mostly pay through their cell phones—even my grandpa pays with his cell phone. Throughout these years, I have noticed many differences between my home country China and the US. Here are 12 differences between life in China and life in the US, based on my experience. 
          </p>
 
 
    <h6>1. Tipping Etiquette</h6>
 
    <p>I noticed that in the US, people usually leave tips in barber shops, restaurants, bars, food delivery etc., as it is considered standard to leave a tip in those places. However, there is no comparable tip culture in China. Restaurants or barber shops in China pay their staff a fixed salary. In fact, if you leave a tip for a waiter or barber, it sometimes offends them, as they might think you are looking down on them by assuming they need that tip.</p>
    
    <h6>2. Shared Laundry Facilities</h6>
    <p>In the US, you often find laundromats on the street. It’s quite convenient for people who don't have a washer and dryer at home, as you can wash your clothes, dry them, and wear them afterwards. But you will not find a single laundromat in China, because, in China, almost every apartment has their own laundry facility or washing machine. Also, a dryer is not common in China as people usually hang clothes up to dry in the sunlight to kill bacteria. 
      </p>


<h6>3. Shopping</h6>

<p>In the US, many people go shopping in shopping malls, stores, or through Amazon. But in China, many people do their shopping through live video streaming services like TikTok, Taobao, or Kwai nowadays. You can purchase anything from live video streaming, from diamonds to toilet paper. The reason why live video streaming shopping is so popular in China is because the price is much cheaper than the retail prices, and customers can see someone explain and try out the product for themselves. </p>


<h6>4. Internet Censorship</h6>

<p>China has heavy censorship of social media and other web services from overseas. For example, Google, YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram are not accessible in China. Though censorship exists, those web services can be accessed through virtual private networks (VPNs). In the US, on the other hand, it’s very liberal, and people can access social media and web services from all over the world. </p>


<h6>6. Subway</h6>

<p>In China, the subway system is very modern, efficient and secure. For example, passengers need to enter through a security gate and their bags need to be screened in an x-ray machine before they can take the subway. In addition, there are protective measures to prevent passanges from falling in or being pushed into the tracks. In the US, take New York as an example, since the subway system was built more than one hundred years ago, the infrastructure is a bit outdated.
</p>

<h6>7. Pedestrian</h6>
<p>In the US, when you walk across a street, you often find that drivers will yield to pedestrians, allowing them to cross the street first. Drivers are more patient with pedestrians in the US. This attitude is rare in China. You often find that cars are in a rush and go right after the light turns green. </p>

<h6>8. First Name</h6>
<p>In the US, people can just call each other by their first name regardless of their seniority or age. But in China, it can be seen as very disrespectful if we call a senior by their first name, so instead people refer to each other based on their titles. </p>

<h6>9. Working Culture</h6>
<p>The working culture in the US is more relaxed than it is in China. Chinese working culture has a clearer hierarchy and is more serious. For example, you rarely see entry-level employees joking with their seniors in China, while people do joke at work in the US. </p>

<h6>10. Housing Price</h6>
<p>Housing prices in the US are more affordable compared with those in China. For example, with the same amount of money, you can buy a big house in big cities in the US, while you may only be able to purchase a bathroom in big cities in China. In fact, with a mortgage, a young person can become a homeowner in the first couple of years of working in the US. However, it’s impossible for a young person to become a homeowner in the big cities of China if they started their career not long ago. </p>

<h6>11. Cost of Manual Labor</h6>
<p>The cost of manual labor is very expensive in the US, while in China, labor costs are much cheaper. For example, last month, I bought a $30 lock for my US home, and the manual installation fee cost me $90, three times more than the cost of the lock itself. In China, the situation would be reversed in that the manual installation fee would cost less than the lock. </p>

<h6>12. Medical Cost</h6>
<p>In the US, medical costs are very expensive compared with those in China. Living in the US, many people are afraid of getting sick when they think of the medical bills. However, in China, though people pay their own medical costs out of pocket and the government doesn’t pay, the medical expenses are still affordable.</p>

<p>Overall, the above differences only reflect my experience. There are also many other differences that are not discussed in this article, like food, population, education, etc.</p>
